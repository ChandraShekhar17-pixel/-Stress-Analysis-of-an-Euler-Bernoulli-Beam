# -Stress-Analysis-of-an-Euler-Bernoulli-Beam
We are creating a program to analyze stress in simply supported beams  subjected to point loads and uniformly distributed loads (UDLs). Users  will input the beam length, load magnitudes, and their positions, and the  program will generate diagrams showing shear force (SFD), bending moment  (BMD), and the beamâ€™s deflection.
